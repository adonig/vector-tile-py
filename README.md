vector-tile-py
==============

This library reads [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec) and allows access to the layers and features.

It is only a very limited demo (only supports points) at this point and not a generic or multi-purpose library.

## Depends

 - Python 2.x
 - Google protobuf python bindings

## Example

```sh
python example.py
```
